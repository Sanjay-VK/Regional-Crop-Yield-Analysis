# Regional-Crop-Yield-Analysis
This project explores agricultural data across India, enhancing it with region classification and geolocation (latitude and longitude). It visualizes crop yields, input usage (fertilizer, pesticide, rainfall), and seasonal trends using both Python (Plotly) and Power BI. The goal is to support smarter agricultural decisions and present insightful dashboards
